Rename 1.2
----------

Rename is a file rename tool. It can upcase, lowcase filenames and can
substitute substrings in filenames. Rename is written in C so it's quicker
than most other renamers written in script, especially when changing large 
numbers of filenames. Rename supports regular expression for matching and
replacing substrings. Its power depends on the user's familiarity of it.
But that's never mind if you know little about regular expression. Even
the simplest string substitution works very well. As an additional function,
rename can handle subdirectories recursive and change file's owner, the 
latter could individually use.


Install
------

Download rename distribution then unpack it with tar -zxf:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Examples
--------

rename foo food
  Change file 'foo' to 'food', just like mv(1) does.

rename -lR *
  To lowcase all filenames, directories and filenames and directories
  under subdirectories.

rename -s/abc/xyz/gi *.c
  Substitute all 'abc' substrings appeared in C  sources  files  with
  'xyz', ignoring case.

rename -vs/.c/.cpp/s *.c
  Change  C sources suffix to C++ sources suffix, with verbose information.

rename -s/abc/12345/bi *
  Find the last occurrence of 'abc'  and  replace  it  with  '12345',
  ignoring case.

rename -o guest -R /home/custom
  change the owner of the file '/home/custom' to 'guest'. The 'guest' should
  be an effective user in the current system. If '/home/custom' is a directory,
  all files in this directory tree will hand to 'guest'.

rename -s/^[A-Z].*file/nofile/r *
  The target substring starts with a capital letter, and ends with string 
  'file'. There are 0 or any numbers of characters between the capital letter
  and 'file'. The substring, if encountered in filenames, will be replaced
  with 'nofile'.
  
rename -s/^[A-Z].+file/nofile/eg *
  Similar to last example, except it uses extended regular expression, such as
  the '+' metacharacter, and replaces all matching strings with 'nofile'.
